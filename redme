Number Base Conversion - Java

This project contains methods for converting numbers between different bases (ranging from 2 to 16)
 and performing some additional number comparisons and array operations.
 The key functions include converting numbers from a string representation to an integer,
 converting integers to a string representation in a different base, and comparing number values.
        Overview
The project provides utility functions to:

        1.	Convert a number in string format from any base (2 to 16) to its decimal (base 10) equivalent.

        2.	Convert a decimal number to a string representation in a given base between 2 and 16.

        3.	Check if two numbers are equal based on their decimal values.

        4.	Find the index of the largest number in an array of numbers represented as strings.


        Features
*	Convert number from base 2 to base 16:
*	The number2Int method converts a string representing a number from a specified base to decimal (base 10).
*	The method handles a wide range of base numbers (from 2 to 16).
        2.	Convert decimal to other bases:
*	The int2Number method takes a decimal number and converts it to a string representation in any base between 2 and 16.
        3.	Number equality check:
*	The equals method compares two numbers in string format and checks if their values (in decimal) are equal.
        4.	Find the maximum number's index:
*	The maxIndex method scans an array of numbers in string format, finds the largest number (in value), and returns its index.
